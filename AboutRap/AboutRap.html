          <h1>How Rap Started</h1>
          <p>Rap music began in the 1970s in the South Bronx, where DJs would loop funky breaks and MCs rapped over them. It emerged from block parties as a form of expression, with rhyming lyrics that often reflected urban life and struggles. By the early '80s, rap had gained mainstream attention and quickly grew into a global cultural phenomenon.</p>

          <h1>How Rap Influenced Other Industries</h1>
          <p style="font-size: 21px;">Rap music, from its early roots in the 1970s to its evolution in the 90s and beyond, has profoundly influenced industries far beyond the music scene. In fashion, the rise of pioneers like Run-D.M.C. in the 1980s, who famously collaborated with Adidas, helped popularize the hip-hop aesthetic of oversized clothing, gold chains, and sportswear. This laid the foundation for the streetwear movement, which continues to dominate global fashion today. In film, the influence of older rap, such as the socially conscious storytelling of Public Enemy or N.W.A., shaped the portrayal of urban life and struggles, leading to the rise of films like Boyz n the Hood and Menace II Society, which mirrored rap’s raw commentary on race, poverty, and systemic injustice. Rap also played a significant role in advertising, with brands like Sprite and Pepsi tapping into the genre's rebellious edge to appeal to younger, urban demographics. Over time, rap’s evolving sound, from the political punch of the '80s to the commercial mainstream success of the '90s and 2000s, has made it a cultural force that reshaped the ways industries communicate with and represent their audiences. Through fashion, advertising, film, and even technology, rap’s influence remains deeply embedded in contemporary culture.</p>
