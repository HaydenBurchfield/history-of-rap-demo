          <h1>How Rap Started</h1>
          <p>Rap music began in the 1970s in the South Bronx, where DJs would loop funky breaks and MCs rapped over them. It emerged from block parties as a form of expression, with rhyming lyrics that often reflected urban life and struggles. By the early '80s, rap had gained mainstream attention and quickly grew into a global cultural phenomenon.</p>
